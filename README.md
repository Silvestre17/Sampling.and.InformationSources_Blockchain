## 📝 Description

This project is a comprehensive research article and presentation exploring **Blockchain technology**. It provides a pedagogical overview of the topic, from its historical origins to its core methodology, key properties, and vast real-world applications. The work also delves into the advantages, disadvantages, and the challenges surrounding the technology's legal framework from a Data Science perspective.

## ✨ Objective

The central objective is to conduct a thorough investigation into Blockchain technology to:
*   📜 Understand its **history and evolution**, from Blockchain 1.0 to 3.0.
*   ⚙️ Explain its fundamental **methodology**, including blocks, transactions, and the distributed chain.
*   🛡️ Detail its core **properties**, such as decentralization, immutability, and security.
*   🌍 Explore its diverse **applicability** across sectors like Finance, Industry, Healthcare, and Governance.
*   ⚖️ Analyze its **advantages, disadvantages**, and the ongoing legal and regulatory challenges.

## 🎓 Project Context

This group project was developed for the **Amostragem e Fontes de Informação** (*Sampling and Information Sources*) course in the **[Licenciatura em Ciência de Dados](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/degree/code/0322/bachelor-degree-in-data-science)** (*Bachelor Degree in Data Science*) at **ISCTE-IUL**, during the 2021/2022 academic year (1st Year, 2nd Semester).

## 🛠️ Tools & Data Sources

This project was primarily a research and reporting effort. The main tools used were for document creation and data sourcing.

## 📚 Project Breakdown: Core Concepts Explored

The project was structured to provide a complete overview of Blockchain technology.

#### 1. History and Evolution
*   **Blockchain 1.0 (2008-2012):** The emergence of **Bitcoin** and the first practical application of blockchain as a decentralized digital currency ledger.
*   **Blockchain 2.0 (2013-2015):** The development of **Ethereum**, which introduced **Smart Contracts** and expanded blockchain's potential beyond simple transactions.
*   **Blockchain 3.0 (2015-Present (2021)):** The "third generation" focusing on improving scalability, interoperability, and security with projects like Hyperledger.

#### 2. Fundamental Methodology
*   **Distributed Ledger:** Blockchain is fundamentally a distributed chain of blocks structured as a list of linked nodes.
*   **Transaction Process:**
    1.  A transaction is recorded as a block of data.
    2.  This block is securely linked to previous and subsequent blocks, forming a cryptographic chain.
    3.  The blocks are validated by consensus among the network's participants, ensuring integrity and immutability.

#### 3. Key Properties of Blockchain
*   **🔗 Immutable:** Once a transaction is validated and added to the chain, it is irreversible and cannot be altered.
*   **🌐 Distributed:** All participants on the network hold a copy of the ledger, eliminating a single point of failure.
*   **🔒 Secure:** Transactions are individually encrypted, and the chain structure makes tampering virtually impossible.
*   **🤝 Unanimous:** All participants must agree on the validity of a transaction before it is added to the ledger (consensus).
*   **👤 Anonymous:** While transactions are transparent, the identities of the participants can be kept anonymous.
*   **💻 Programmable:** The technology can be programmed to execute automatically, most notably through **Smart Contracts**.

#### 4. Real-World Applications Explored
The research covered a wide array of sectors where Blockchain is making an impact:
*   **Finance:** Cryptocurrencies, secure transactions, financial flow traceability.
*   **Industry:** Supply chain tracking (e.g., Nestlé), asset management, anti-counterfeiting.
*   **Governance:** E-voting, secure digital documentation, and transparent public administration.
*   **Healthcare:** Secure management of electronic health records (EHR) and clinical trial data.
*   **Other Areas:** Digital identity, intellectual property, Internet of Things (IoT), and education.

## 🚀 Deployment & Deliverables

The final deliverables for this research project were:
*   A **comprehensive research article** detailing all the findings, structured for a technical audience as you can see in the [Research Article](./Group5_AFI_ArtigoDivulgacao_Blockchain.pdf).

*   A **16-minute oral presentation** summarizing the key aspects of the research article, which can be viewed in the [Presentation](./Grupo5_AFI_Blockchain.pdf) (PowerPoint slides).
*   *(As this was a research project, there is no interactive dashboard.)*
